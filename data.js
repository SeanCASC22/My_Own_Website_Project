Such a soft, sweet, soothing voice... I couldn't help but try to listen. A lot of what was being said to me seemed to quickly fade from my memory, as if the voice was never there. Was I in a trance? I couldn't be certain, but I wasn't where I had fell asleep for the night. Upon waking up, I seemed to be in a new world. Why and how?"

What other choice did I have but to keep going when I was lost here? There was no way out of this... or is there? Maybe if I look around... but I needed a source of light.",

The only remains of what used to be an endless empire are dust, artifacts, and collapsed formations. It's like I'm in a labyrinth. As I looked up at the dome that covered the place and thought about everything that I've seen, I couldn't help but feel obligated to get out. There is nothing here.",

Why do I feel like I'm not doing this the way I'm supposed to? Being normal would help me actually understand what it's like to fully experience this world. Could I sacrifice my gift of Creation...?",
